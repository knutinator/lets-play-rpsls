# Let’s play RPSLS! (Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock)

A browser based JavaScript game which can be played against the computer or another human player.
It is a variant of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game, but expanded with two extra choices: Lizard and Spock, as popularized in the TV series “The Big Bang Theory”.

The game is simple: The player chooses one of five symbols to play with, then the computer (or the other player) does the same. Whichever player’s symbol “beats” the other, wins the round. (See rules below) The goal of the game is to be the first to win five rounds.

The game rules (as quoted form the show)

“Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
Rock crushes Lizard
Lizard poisons Spock
Spock smashes Scissors
Scissors decapitates Lizard
Lizard eats Paper
Paper disproves Spock
Spock vaporizes Rock
and (as it always has) Rock crushes Scissors.”
